[theGame](//github.com/tmaj87/theGame)

## What's interesting here?
- definitely check [EncryptedChat](EncryptedChat/src/main/java/it/justDo/chat/), to get some private messaging system
- if you are interested in evolution mechanisms and how to define them in computer language, check [Evolution](Evolution/src/main/java/it/justDo/evolution/) directory
- [ScreenCapture.java](ScreenCapture/ScreenCapture.java) is an easy way to get image from all monitors saved as jpg file 
- or maby an example of how to embed text in to an image using [ImageDotPngEncryption](ImageEncryption/main/java/pl/tmaj/)

## Learning and improvements

There are implementations of few design patterns ([abstract factory](patterns/AbstractFactory/src/test/java/pl/tmaj/AbstractFactoryTest.java), [observer](patterns/ObserverPattern/src/main/java/pl/tmaj/GrabStocks.java), [command](patterns/CommandPattern/src/test/java/pl/tmaj/CommandTest.java])) here as well, as [playground](UnitTests/src/test/java/MainTest.java) for tests. A little bit of [mocking](UnitTests/src/test/java/MessageTest.java) as well. Few [katas](kata/) as well.

#### ...and also don't forget to look into [Misc](Misc) to find gems like [XORCipher](Misc/XORCipher.java) or [shake your mouse pointer](Misc/AutoIt.java)
